    <p>
      Make no mistake – only through a healthy diet and with regular physical
      activity, weight loss can be achieved because this combination creates
      calorie deficit that pushes the body to reach for stored fat to meet its
      energy demands. But many people, in desperation to shed extra weight and
      get lean, tend to fall for heavily-marketed fat burner pills and appetite
      suppressant potions that tend to have side effects with questionable
      ingredients and efficacy. Since burning fat is the theme behind losing
      weight, it’s easy to fall prey to these marketing gimmicks. Instead of
      fat-burning pills, we would like to draw your attention towards food
      sources that have amazing fat-burning properties sans the side effects.
